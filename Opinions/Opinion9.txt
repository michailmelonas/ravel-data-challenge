Opinion

Petitioner {partyA_}Sharp Electronics Corporation{/partyA_} ("{partyA_}Sharp Electronics{/partyA_}") seeks an order to compel respondent {partyB_}Branded Products, Inc.{/partyB_} ("{partyB_}Branded{/partyB_}") to arbitrate in New York City disputes arising from a distributorship agreement between the two parties. It also seeks to stay a Texas court proceeding between the two parties which was commenced by {partyB_}Branded{/partyB_}. A third party, {partyC_}Charles B. Allen, Inc.{/partyC_} ("{partyC_}Allen{/partyC_}"), is also a defendant in the Texas proceeding. {partyA_}Sharp Electronics{/partyA_} is a New York corporation with its principal place of business in New Jersey. {partyB_}Branded{/partyB_} is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Texas. {partyC_}Allen{/partyC_} is a Texas corporation with its principal place of business in that state.

Respondent {partyB_}Branded{/partyB_} has moved to dismiss the petition on grounds that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. It also seeks to stay arbitration on the grounds that [**2]  an amended complaint in the Texas action eliminates all contract disputes and the contract requiring arbitration was a contract of adhesion. For the following reasons, respondent's motions to dismiss the petition and to stay arbitration are denied and petitioner's request for an order compelling arbitration is granted.
